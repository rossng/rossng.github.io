For the last eight months, I have been learning Turkish. It's hard. Mostly because it's much more distant from English than any language I have studied previously (French, Latin, Danish, Dutch).

When you are learning a language, sometimes you encounter tasks for which you need to develop automaticity (i.e. muscle memory, but for your mind). For example: word endings; choosing the correct preposition; counting.

To develop automaticity, you need a way to rapidly and repeatedly give yourself problems to solve. And, ideally, to get instantaneous feedback on your answer. But the resources are often scant. Perhaps there are only 5-10 examples in your textbook. Or you find a set of digital flashcards, but they are mixed with irrelevant content.

But you can program a computer! It's not exactly hard to build yourself an interactive quiz. So you should do that, and customise it exactly to your needs.

It turns out I am [not the first person to have come to this conclusion](https://leerob.com/n/personal-software) and we are now calling this _Personal Software_. Apparently I'm meant to be letting an LLM generate it for me, but I don't think we're quite there yet.

I have started collecting [my tools for learning Turkish](https://www.rossng.eu/merhaba/). It's no [MathAcademy](https://mathacademy.com/) (aside: what they are doing is really cool), but these are mine.
