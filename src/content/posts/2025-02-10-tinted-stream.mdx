From time to time, I just want to display a single block colour on my computer's entire screen. So I Google something like 'fullscreen solid colour' and just click links until I find something that works.

But each time, I get a small papercut from the state of the web today. Here are the results Google serves me:

1. _Full Black Screen, White Screen & Color Screen Tool_ - {<span className="text-gray-500">https://www.fullscreen.one</span>}

   This one immediately pops up a huge modal cookie banner. It requires eight (eight!) clicks to disable everything and wants to send my data to literally hundreds of companies.

1. _Color Aurlien_ - {<span className="text-gray-500">http://color.aurlien.net</span>}

   No fullscreen button. Neat UI but kinda difficult to control what colour you select.

1. _Full Screen Red Color - PiliApp_ - {<span className="text-gray-500">https://www.piliapp.com/screen/red</span>}

   Can't choose an arbitrary colour. Hard to remember the URL.

1. _Black Screen - Make your screen DAZZLING!_ - {<span className="text-gray-500">https://www.fullblackscreen.com</span>}

   The exact same terrible cookie banner as the first result.

1. Three irrelevant results from the Microsoft forums and Reddit
1. A tool for generating solid colour PNGs
1. _colorscreen.io_ - {<span className="text-gray-500">https://colorscreen.io</span>}

   A non-functional parked domain. How did this make it to the first page of the results?

On page 5, you reach the first decent result: _whitetestscreen.com_. But it uses `<input type="color">` for its colour picker which (as a Firefox on macOS user) is rather clunky.

It turns out that TLDs like `.top` and `.stream` are dirt cheap. So I built a [single-serving site](https://singleservingsites.cool/) to scratch my own itch.

{

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
  <a
    href="https://tinted.stream"
    title="Open tinted.stream in a new tab to show a solid colour in fullscreen"
    target="_blank"
    className="mx-auto rounded border-2 border-black bg-gradient-to-b from-[#ff7e5f] to-[#feb47b] p-5 text-2xl text-black no-underline hover:bg-gradient-to-b hover:from-[#feb47b] hover:to-[#ff7e5f]"
  >
    tinted.stream
  </a>
</div>
}

I'll probably add a few more input fields in future (e.g. hex RGB strings). Tell me below if you see a need for something specific.

I haven't employed any black hat SEO (or spelled the word colour 'correctly'), so I look forward to Google ignoring the site entirely. Hopefully someone finds it useful though. I'll never know, because I didn't add any tracking.
