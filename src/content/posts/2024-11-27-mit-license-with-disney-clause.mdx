  MIT License with Disney Clause
---

A while back I read about [Disney's dismissal attempt against a court case](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/15/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-dismissal) concerning someone's death due to an allergic reaction after they ate at a restaurant in a Disney theme park.

Their justification for this? The person bringing the case had previously signed up for Disney+ and, in doing so, had agreed to waive their right to sue Disney. (Yes, this is somehow often legally binding in the USA.)

Perhaps it would be good for large corporations to remember that they also benefit significantly from existing in a society that treats them fairly.

In any case, I present to you a new, potentially legally-inadvisable, licence for open source software.

(It should be noted that, after significant public pressure, Disney did decide to backtrack on their attempt to have the case dismissed.)
