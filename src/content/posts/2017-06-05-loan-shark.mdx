As part of the computer science course at the University of Bristol, I built a game over the span of a year with a team of six people. It was tonnes of fun and one of the best things about the degree programme at Bristol.

Loan Shark is an asymmetric, networked multiplayer VR diving game. Several players work as a team to retrieve treasure from a wreck at the bottom of the ocean while an angry shark - controlled by the player in VR - hunts them down. Loan Shark features numerous graphical effects, integrated voice chat, motion-captured animation, procedurally generated mazes and support for the Myo gesture control armband.

I wish I had taken some screen recordings, but my laptop was too slow to record at a decent frame rate while actually running the game.

Fun fact: the team is actually named after a kind of lettuce.
