I've spent a lot of the last couple of years thinking about brick walls, thanks to having been working at [Monumental](https://www.monumental.co/) that whole time.

I thought it would be fun to make a little toy that lets you build your own (virtual) brick wall at home.

Bricks can be laid in many different patterns, known as ['bonds'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brickwork#Load-bearing_bonds). At first it looks like all these bonds can be expressed in a fairly simple way, but it's surprisingly fiddly to make things line up nicely and fill left over space in a way that complies with the bond pattern.

Anyway, I've ignored all of that and just tried to express bonds in the [easiest way possible](https://github.com/rossng/muural/blob/708799bc1fba81ab2e3dfc07f685d448e9f67729/src/data/Bonds.ts).

Want to do this full time, but also it's robots and in 3D? [Have a look at our open positions](https://www.monumental.co/jobs).
