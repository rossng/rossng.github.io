For the last eight months, I have been learning Turkish. It's hard - much more distant from English than languages I have studied previously (French, Latin, Danish, Dutch).

When you are learning a language, sometimes you encounter a task for which you need to develop automaticity (i.e. muscle memory but inside your mind). For example: word endings; picking the correct preposition; counting.

To do this, you need a way to rapidly and repeatedly give yourself problems to solve. And, ideally, to get instantaneous feedback on your answer. But the resources are often scant. Perhaps there are only 5-10 example in your textbook. Or you find a set of digital flashcards, but they are mixed with irrelevant content.

But you can program a computer! It's not exactly hard to build yourself an interactive quiz. So you should do that.

It turns out I am [not the first person to have come to this conclusion](https://leerob.com/n/personal-software) and we're now calling this Personal Software. (And apparently I'm meant to be letting an LLM generate it for me.)
