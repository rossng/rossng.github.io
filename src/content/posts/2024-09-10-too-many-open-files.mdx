Sometimes you might encounter an error message like this:

```
Too many open files (os error 24)
```

Too many open files? That seems clear enough. A bit of googling&mdash;or prodding of your preferred LLM&mdash;will tell you that
this is caused by the nofiles ulimit. Easy to solve. Except you then increase that limit to something huge like a million, and the error doesn't go away.

There is another possibility: in your application you are watching files for changes, and you are hitting a different
limit. File watching on Linux (generally) uses inotify internally, and that has its own limits (which are helpfully configured in a completely different
place). Those limits are `max_user_instances`, `max_user_watches` and `max_queued_events` ([see inotify(7) man for more details](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html)).

You can manually set these limits using `sysctl`. For example:

```sh
sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192
```

I ran into this because `max_user_instances` [defaults to 128](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/36214)(!) on NixOS.
As an ivory tower-enjoying NixOS user, you will of course instead want to set your limits like this:

```nix
boot.kernel.sysctl = {
    "fs.inotify.max_user_instances" = "8192";
};
```
