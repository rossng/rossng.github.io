I cofounded and was CTO for Midspace (originally Clowdr), a virtual conference platform that aimed to provide a viable, low-carbon alternative to in-person academic conferences.

- Built open-source platform for running virtual conferences.
- Designed and built cloud infrastructure.
- Worked directly with our customers to design new features and provide support.

[The Midspace codebase is completely open source.](https://github.com/clowdr-app/clowdr/)
