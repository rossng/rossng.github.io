I worked as a C#/.NET developer for International Engineering. I spent a few weeks researching possible integration of Amazon Machine Learning into the Just Eat platform, after which I joined in with day-to-day sprint work. My colleague and I won part of the Just Eat Hackathon with a Pebble smartwatch app.
