**First Class, 76%**

Awarded 2018 Wertheimer Memorial Prize for contribution to the Department of Computer Science.

### First year

* Programming and Algorithms (C, Haskell, Java, JavaScript)
* Theory of Computation (automata, grammars)
* Introduction to Computer Architecture (digital electronics, ISAs/CPU design, compilers)
* Mathematical Methods for Computer Scientists (logic, modular arithmetic, probability, calculus)
* Origins of Computer Science
* French

#### December 2014

Presented a vision for bitcoin-mining funded websites as part of the Origins of Computer Science unit and built a small prototype. It kinda came true!

Built an antweight robot for the first [Bristol University Robot Wars](https://www.facebook.com/events/1736418089917060).

#### January 2015

[Built an 8-step sequencer](http://neosequencer.tumblr.com/) at the [ARM Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/312109635651993).

#### March 2015

Entered *Nicolas Cagefighter* into the [second BEEES Robot Wars competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsDj1u2iBhk). Reserving the name *Theresa Mayhem* for next time.

Built a responsive webapp using Google App Engine for the [2015 Mubaloo appathon](http://mubaloo.com/news-info/university-of-bristol-appathon-2015).

### Second year

* Concurrent Computing ([CSP](https://github.com/rossng/CspBookHs), XC, [operating systems](https://github.com/rossng/malapropOS), networking)
* Software Product Engineering (built [a compiler](https://github.com/TransputerSystems/TSS) for the occam language and Transputer)
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Symbols, Patterns and Signals (statistics, machine learning)
* Language Engineering ([compilers](https://github.com/rossng/COMS22201-whilst-compiler), axiomatic/denotational/operational semantics)
* French ([written project comparing OCaml and Eiffel](https://github.com/rossng/LANG22022-projet-ecrit/blob/master/report.pdf))

#### January 2016

Attempted to build a pinball table for the BEEES ARM Hackathon. I wrote most of the embedded software (Python on RPi, C++ on mbed).

### Third year

* High Performance Computing (OpenMP, MPI, OpenCL)
* Artificial Intelligence with Logic Programming (Prolog)
* Computer Graphics ([raytracer](https://github.com/RickyBoyd/cg-raytracer), [rasteriser](https://github.com/RickyBoyd/cg-rasteriser))
* Image Processing and Computer Vision
* Computational Neuroscience
* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Design Verification (SystemVerilog, e)
* Games Project (our game: [Loan Shark](http://www.rossng.eu/meta/2017/06/05/loan-shark.html))

#### February 2017

Organised [Boeing-sponsored hackathon](https://cssbristol.co.uk/pages/hackathon-2017) (and built a 3D visualisation tool for monitoring device temps).

### Fourth year

* Interactive Devices ([project published at CHI 2018](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3188486))
* Cloud Computing
* Applied Deep Learning
* Internet Economics and Financial Technology
* Advanced Computer Architecture ([my Haskell simulator for a superscalar pipelined CPU](https://github.com/rossng/aku))
* Systems Security
* Masters Thesis [*Free Trade: Composable Smart Contracts*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326693413_Free_Trade_Composable_Smart_Contracts)
* Research Proposal

#### February 2018

Organised second [Boeing-sponsored hackathon](https://cssbristol.co.uk/pages/hackathon-2018) (and built AR Mars robot simulator with Iridium sat comms).

#### April 2018

Attended [CHI 2018](http://chi2018.acm.org/) in Montreal to present a poster for [Choptop](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3188486).
