 </h1> <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"> 2024-11-27 </p> </div> <p>A while back I read about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/15/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-dismissal">Disney’s dismissal attempt against a court case</a> concerning someone’s death due to an allergic reaction after they ate at a restaurant in a Disney theme park.</p>
<p>Their justification for this? The person bringing the case had previously signed up for Disney+ and, in doing so, had agreed to waive their right to sue Disney. (Yes, this is somehow often legally binding in the USA.)</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be good for large corporations to remember that they also benefit significantly from existing in a society that treats them fairly.</p>
<p>In any case, I present to you a new, potentially legally-inadvisable, licence for open source software.</p>

<p>(It should be noted that, after significant public pressure, Disney did decide to backtrack on their attempt to have the case dismissed.)</p>   </div> <footer class="text-center text-xs mt-4 mb-4"> <a href="https://github.com/rossng/rossng.github.io/blob/main/README.md" class="text-gray-500">&copy;</a> </footer> </body></html>
